# Introduction
This report analyzes the relationship between arrest rates and property prices in Dallas by zip code.
Using datasets on arrests and property values, we aim to identify any correlations that may exist at the neighborhood level.


## Data handling
``` {r data_handling, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
arrests <- read.csv("DallasArrests_cleaned.csv")
zillow <- read.csv("Zillow-dallas.csv")

# Count Arrests per Zip Code
arrests_per_zip <- arrests %>%
  group_by(Zipcode = Arrest.Zipcode) %>%
  summarise(Arrest_Count = n())

# Calculate Average or Median Property Prices per Zip Code
property_price_stats <- zillow %>%
  group_by(Zipcode = addressZipcode) %>%
  summarise(
    Average_Price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Price = median(price, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Merge the Results
summary_df <- merge(arrests_per_zip, property_price_stats, by = "Zipcode")

# Save the Results
print(summary_df)
write.csv(summary_df, "Dallas_Arrests_Property_Summary.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```



# Data visulization
``` {r plot, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(summary_df, aes(x = Average_Price, y = Arrest_Count)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Arrest Counts vs. Average Property Price by Zip Code",
    x = "Average Property Price",
    y = "Total Arrests"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
